## Code Overview
<h5>

The program consists of several functions:

generateRandom: Generates a random number between given min and max (inclusive).

fileRead: Reads a random line (word) from a file with the given path.

generatePass: Generates a password with the given number of words.

stageZeroDraw: Draws the Stage 0 screen, where the user can click the "Generate" button.

stageOneDraw: Draws the Stage 1 screen, where the user can input the number of words for the password.

stageTwoDraw: Draws the Stage 2 screen, where the generated password is displayed, and the user can generate another password.

main: The main function that initializes the window, runs the game loop, and handles user input.

Please note that the program expects the dictionaries to be located in the following path:

```sh
"assets/dictionaries/%d.txt"
```
Make sure to place the dictionaries in the specified path or modify the path in the generatePass function accordingly.
</h5>

## C Standard Library Functions
<h5>

`srand(time(NULL)):` Seeds the random number generator with the current time. This ensures that the random numbers generated by the rand() function are different each time the program is run.

`rand() % (max - min + 1)) + min:` Generates a random integer between min and max, inclusive.

`malloc():` Allocates memory dynamically. In the fileRead() function, memory is allocated for the pword pointer to store the word read from the file.

`strcat():` Concatenates two strings. In the generatePass() function, it's used to concatenate the words read from the file.

strcmp(): Compares two strings for equality. It's used in the generatePass() function to check if the read word is "ERROR!".

`strlen()`: Returns the length of a string. It's used in the generatePass() function to iterate through the generated password string.

`strcpy()`: Copies a string from source to destination. In the fileRead() function, it's used to copy the word read from the file to the pword pointer.

`strcspn()`: Finds the first occurrence of any character in a set of characters within a string. In the fileRead() function, it's used to find the newline character (\n) in pword.

`atoi()`: Converts a string to an integer. In the main function, it's used to convert the user input string wordPass to an integer.

`sprintf()`: Writes formatted output to a string. In the generatePass() function, it's used to create the file path for the dictionary files.
</h5>

## Custom Functions
<h5>

`generateRandom(min, max)`: Generates a random number between min and max, inclusive.

`fileRead(path[])`: Reads a random word from a file with the given path.

`generatePass(wordPassCounter, pass)`: Generates a password with the given number of words (wordPassCounter) and stores it in the pass string.

`stageZeroDraw()`: Draws the Stage 0 screen, where the user can click the "Generate" button.

`stageOneDraw(wordPass, finalCheck)`: Draws the Stage 1 screen, where the user can input the number of words for the password.

`stageTwoDraw(pass, wordPassCounter)`: Draws the Stage 2 screen, where the generated password is displayed, and the user can generate another password.

These custom functions work together with the Raylib functions and C standard library functions to create a fully functional password generator application with an intuitive graphical user interface.
</h5>

## Raylib
<h5>

Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library for creating video games and multimedia applications. It is written in C and is highly portable. In this password generator application, Raylib is used to create the graphical user interface, handle user input, and manage the game loop.

Below are some key Raylib functions and syntaxes used in the password generator:
</h5>

### Initialization and Window Management

<h5>

`InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "Window Title")`: Initializes the window with the specified width, height, and title.

`SetTargetFPS(30)`: Sets the target frames per second (FPS) for the application.

`WindowShouldClose()`: Returns true if the window close button or ESC key is pressed.

`CloseWindow()`: Closes and unloads the window.

### Drawing
<h5>

`BeginDrawing()`: Begins the drawing process. All the drawing functions should be called between 
BeginDrawing() and EndDrawing().


`ClearBackground(color)`: Sets the background color of the window.


`DrawText("Text", x, y, fontSize, color)`: Draws text on the screen with the specified position, font size, and color.

`DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, color)`: Draws a rectangle with the specified position, dimensions, and color.

`DrawRectangleRec(Rectangle, color)`: Draws a rectangle with the specified Rectangle structure and color.

`EndDrawing()`: Ends the drawing process.
</h5>

### Input Handling

<h5>

`IsMouseButtonDown(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON)`: Returns true if the left mouse button is pressed.

`GetMousePosition():` Returns a Vector2 structure containing the current position of the mouse cursor.

`CheckCollisionPointRec(Vector2, Rectangle):` Checks if a point (Vector2) is inside a rectangle (Rectangle).

`IsMouseButtonReleased(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON):` Returns true if the left mouse button is released.

`GetKeyPressed()`: Returns the key code of the last key pressed.
</h5>

### Structures
<h5>

`Rectangle:` A structure that defines a rectangle with position (x, y) and dimensions (width, height)
Example usage: Rectangle rect = {x, y, width, height};.

`Vector2`: A structure that defines a two-dimensional vector with x and y components. Example usage: Vector2 vector = {x, y};.
</h5>

### Colors
<h5>

Raylib provides predefined color constants for convenience. Some of the colors used in this password generator are:

BEIGE: Beige color.
BLACK: Black color.
WHITE: White color.
LIGHTGRAY: Light gray color.
GOLD: Gold color.
RED: Red color.

These color constants are used as arguments in various drawing functions, such as ClearBackground(color) and DrawText("Text", x, y, fontSize, color).
</h5>

### Additional Raylib Functions and Syntaxes
<h5>

`IsMouseButtonDown(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON)`: Checks if the left mouse button is currently pressed. It's used in the stageZeroDraw() and stageOneDraw() functions to determine if the user has clicked on the "Generate" and "Next" buttons.

`CheckCollisionPointRec(GetMousePosition(), rectangle)`: Checks if a point (in this case, the mouse position) is inside a rectangle. Used in combination with IsMouseButtonDown() to determine if the user has clicked on a button.

`GetMousePosition()`: Returns the current mouse position as a 2D vector. It's used as an argument for the CheckCollisionPointRec() function to check if the mouse is inside a button.

`IsMouseButtonReleased(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON)`: Checks if the left mouse button has been released after being pressed. It's used in the stageTwoDraw() function to determine if the user has clicked the "Generate Another" button.

`MeasureText(text, fontSize)`: Returns the width of the given text string when rendered with the specified font size. It's used in the stageTwoDraw() function to calculate the x-coordinate for centering the generated password on the screen.
