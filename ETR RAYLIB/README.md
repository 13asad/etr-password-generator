# Easy To Remember Password Generator

This is a simple, easy-to-remember password generator built using C and the Raylib graphics library. The software enables users to create passwords by combining words and hyphenating them. Users can choose between 3 and 4 words for their password, and the program will then generate a password in accordance with their selection.

## Features
<h5>

* Generate easy-to-remember passwords.

* Allows the user to input the number of words (3 or 4) for the password.

* Uses the Raylib graphics library for a clean user interface.
</h5>

## Dependencies
<h5>

`Raylib:` This project uses the Raylib graphics library for the user interface.

Download it from [raylib.com](raylib.com).
</h5>

## Compilation
<h5>

To compile the project, make sure you have the Raylib library installed and added to your system's PATH and use the following command:

```sh 
gcc main.c -o main.exe -lraylib
```
**Replace main.c with the name of the C file containing the code and the main.exe with the a name for the executable.**

</h5>

<h5>

1. Run the compiled executable main.exe.
2. Click on the "Generate" button on the main screen.
3. Enter the number of words (3 or 4) that you want for your password.
3. Click on the "Next" button.
4. The generated password will then be displayed on the screen.
5. Click on the "Generate Another" button to generate another password.
</h5>

## Code Overview
<h5>

The program consists of several functions:

**`generateRandom`**: This generates a random number between the min and max (inclusive).

**`fileRead`**: Reads a random line (word) from a file with the provded path.

**`generatePass`**: Generates a password with the given number of words by the user.

**`stageZeroDraw`**: Draws the Stage 0 screen, where the user can click the "Generate" button.

**`stageOneDraw`**: Draws the Stage 1 screen, where the user can input the number of words for the password.

**`stageTwoDraw`**: Draws the Stage 2 screen, where the generated password is displayed, and the user can generate another password.

**`main`**: The main function that initialises the window, runs the game loop, and handles user input.

Note that the dictionaries must be located in the following path:

```sh
"assets/dictionaries/%d.txt"
```
Make sure to place the dictionaries in the specified path or alternatively modify the path in the `generatePass` function accordingly.
</h5>

## C Standard Library Functions
<h5>

**`srand(time(NULL)):`** Seeds the random number generator with the current time. This make sure that the random numbers generated by the rand() function are different each time the program is run.

**`rand() % (max - min + 1)) + min:`** Generates a random integer between min and max, inclusive.

**`malloc():`** Allocates the memory dynamically. In the `fileRead()` function, memory is allocated for the `pword` pointer to store the word read from the file.

**`strcat():`** Concatenates two strings. In the `generatePass()` function, it is used to concatenate the words that have been read from the file.

**`strcmp():`** Compares two strings for equality. It is used in the generatePass() function to check if the read word is "ERROR!".

**`strlen()`**: Returns the length of a string. It is used in the `generatePass()` function to iterate through the generated password string.

**`strcpy()`**: Copies a string from its source to a destination. In the `fileRead()` function, it is used to copy the word read from the file to the `pword` pointer.

**`strcspn()`**: Finds the first occurrence of any character in a set of characters within a string. In the `fileRead()` function, it's used to find the newline character (\n) in `pword`.

**`atoi()`**: Converts a string to an integer. In the main function, it's used to convert the user input string wordPass to an integer.

**`sprintf()`**: Writes formatted output to a string. In the `generatePass()` function, it is used to create the file path for the dictionary files.
</h5>

## Custom Functions
<h5>

**`generateRandom(min, max)`**: Generates a random number between min and max, inclusive.

**`fileRead(path[])`**: Reads a random word from a file with the given path.

**`generatePass(wordPassCounter, pass)`**: Generates a password with the given number of words (wordPassCounter) and stores it in the pass string.

**`stageZeroDraw()`**: Draws the Stage 0 screen, where the user can click the "Generate" button.

**`stageOneDraw(wordPass, finalCheck)`**: Draws the Stage 1 screen, where the user can input the number of words for the password.

**`stageTwoDraw(pass, wordPassCounter)`**: Draws the Stage 2 screen, where the generated password is displayed, and the user can generate another password.

These custom functions work together with the Raylib functions and C standard library functions  to produce a fully functional password generation program with a simple graphical user interface.
</h5>

## Raylib
<h5>

Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library for creating graphical applications and interactive user interfaces. It was made in C and is very portable. Raylib is used in this password generating application to build the graphical user interface, manage user input, and control the game loop.

Key Raylib syntaxes and functions used in the password generator are listed below:
</h5>

### Initialisation and Window Management

<h5>

**`InitWindow(screenWidth, screenHeight, "Window Title")`**: Initialises the window with the specified width, height, and title.

**`SetTargetFPS(30)`**: Sets the target frames per second (FPS) for the application.

**`WindowShouldClose()`**: Returns true if the window close button or ESC key is pressed.

**`CloseWindow()`**: Closes and unloads the window.

### Drawing
<h5>

**`BeginDrawing()`**: Begins the drawing process. All the drawing functions should be called between 
BeginDrawing() and EndDrawing().


**`ClearBackground(color)`**: Sets the background color of the window.


**`DrawText("Text", x, y, fontSize, color)`**: Draws text on the screen with the specified position, font size, and color.

**`DrawRectangle(x, y, width, height, color)`**: Draws a rectangle with the specified position, dimensions, and color.

**`DrawRectangleRec(Rectangle, color)`**: Draws a rectangle with the specified Rectangle structure and color.

**`EndDrawing()`**: Ends the drawing process.
</h5>

### Loading Animation in stageTwoDraw

<h5>

In the `stageTwoDraw()` function, a simple loading animation is added using a spinner. The following syntaxes and functions are used for the loading animation:

**`GetFrameTime()`**: Returns the elapsed time in seconds since the last frame. It's used to control the spinner animation speed and ensures that the spinner is drawn smoothly.

**`spinnerIndex = (spinnerIndex + 1) % (sizeof(spinner) - 1);`**: Updates the spinnerIndex, cycling through the spinner characters (|, /, -, and \\) to create the spinning effect.


### Input Handling

<h5>

**`IsMouseButtonDown(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON)`**: Returns true if the left mouse button is pressed.

**`GetMousePosition():`** Returns a Vector2 structure containing the current position of the mouse cursor.

**`CheckCollisionPointRec(Vector2, Rectangle):`** Checks if a point (Vector2) is inside a rectangle (Rectangle).

**`IsMouseButtonReleased(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON):`** Returns true if the left mouse button is released.

**`GetKeyPressed()`**: Returns the key code of the last key pressed.
</h5>

### Structures
<h5>

**`Rectangle:`** A structure that defines a rectangle with position (x, y) and dimensions (width, height)
Example usage: Rectangle rect = {x, y, width, height};.

**`Vector2`**: A structure that defines a two-dimensional vector with x and y components. Example usage: Vector2 vector = {x, y};.
</h5>

### Colors
<h5>

Raylib provides predefined colour constants for convenience. Some of the colours used in this password generator are:

BEIGE: Beige colour.

BLACK: Black colour.

WHITE: White colour.

LIGHTGRAY: Light gray colour.

GOLD: Gold colour.

RED: Red colour.

These color constants are used as arguments in various drawing functions, such as ClearBackground(colour) and DrawText("Text", x, y, fontSize, colour).
</h5>

### Additional Raylib Functions and Syntaxes
<h5>

**`IsMouseButtonDown(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON)`**: Checks if the left mouse button is currently pressed. It's used in the stageZeroDraw() and stageOneDraw() functions to determine if the user has clicked on the "Generate" and "Next" buttons.

**`CheckCollisionPointRec(GetMousePosition(), rectangle)`**: Checks if a point (in this case, the mouse position) is inside a rectangle. Used in combination with IsMouseButtonDown() to determine if the user has clicked on a button.

**`GetMousePosition()`**: Returns the current mouse position as a 2D vector. It's used as an argument for the CheckCollisionPointRec() function to check if the mouse is inside a button.

**`IsMouseButtonReleased(MOUSE_LEFT_BUTTON)`**: Checks if the left mouse button has been released after being pressed. It's used in the stageTwoDraw() function to determine if the user has clicked the "Generate Another" button.

**`MeasureText(text, fontSize)`**: Returns the width of the given text string when rendered with the specified font size. It's used in the stageTwoDraw() function to calculate the x-coordinate for centering the generated password on the screen.
